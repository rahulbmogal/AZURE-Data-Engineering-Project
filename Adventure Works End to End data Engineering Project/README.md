## Project Overview

This is an end-to-end data engineering project on the Azure cloud. Where I did data ingestion from an on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake using Data Factory to transformation using Databricks and Spark, loading to Synapse, and reporting using PowerBI. Also, I used Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for data monitoring and governance purposes.

## Dataset
AdventureWorks is a database provided by Microsoft for free on online platforms. It is a product sample database originally published by Microsoft to demonstrate the supposed design of an SQL server database using SQL server.
- AdventureWorks database supports a manufacturing MNC named Adventure Works Cycles.
- It is a sample Online Transaction Processing (or OLTP) database, which is a type of data processing where multiple transactions occur concurrently. These are shipped by Microsoft with all of their SQL server products.

## Project Goals
- Establish a connection between on-premise SQL server and Azure cloud.
- Ingest tables into the Azure Data Lake.
- Apply data cleaning and transformation using Azure Databricks.
- Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics for loading clean data.
- Create interactive data visualizations and reports with Microsoft Power BI.
- Implement Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for monitoring and governance.

## Key Insights:

   Total Revenue: $ 708,300.00
   
   Total Sales: $ 713,600.00
   
   Touring Bikes is the top 1 category generating revenue with 32% followed by Road Bikes with 26% and Mountain Bikes with 24%.
   
   Total Number of customers are 847
   
   Revenue by Gender
    59% of the revenue is generated by Male customers and 41% of the revenue is generated by Female customers.
    This can be explained by males have more interest in doing outdoor activities with the different categories of 
    Bikes than females.

## Data Ingestion
The data ingestion phase lays the foundation for our analytics journey, bridging the gap between on-premise data sources and the Azure cloud. Leveraging Microsoft Integration Runtime, we establish a secure and reliable connection between our on-premise SQL Server and Azure, enabling seamless data transfer to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. With Azure Data Factory orchestrating the ingestion process, we ensure efficient and scalable movement of data, setting the stage for subsequent analysis and insights generation.

Connected the on-premise SQL Server with Azure using Microsoft Integration Runtime.

## Resources
Setup the Resource group with needed services (Key Vault, Storage Account, Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics)

## Migration
Migrated the tables from on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## Data Transformation
Mounted Azure Blob Storage to Databricks to retrieve raw data from the Data Lake.
Used Spark Cluster in Azure Databricks to clean and refine the raw data.
Saved the cleaned data in a Delta format; optimized for further analysis.

## Data Loading
In the data transformation phase, we unleash the power of Azure Databricks and Spark to unlock the full potential of our raw data. By mounting Azure Blob Storage to Databricks, we gain access to our data lake and embark on a journey of discovery and refinement. Utilizing the computational prowess of Spark clusters, we apply sophisticated transformations and data cleaning techniques to prepare our data for downstream processing. The resulting cleansed and refined datasets, stored in Delta format, are optimized for further analysis and insights extraction.

Used Azure Synapse Analytics to load the refined data efficiently.
Created SQL database and connected it to the data lake.

## Data Reporting
In the final phase of our journey, we unlock the true value of our data through immersive data reporting and visualization. Connecting Microsoft Power BI to Azure Synapse, we harness the rich insights stored in our SQL databases and craft interactive and insightful data visualizations. From dynamic dashboards to granular reports, Power BI empowers stakeholders to explore data trends, uncover hidden patterns, and derive actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making.

Connected Microsoft Power BI to Azure Synapse and used the Views of the DB to create interactive and insightful data visualizations.
